# odin-mini-message-board

Project: Mini Message Board from The Odin Project's NodeJS course

My first Express app! The project that finally made all of the lessons on routes/routers, models, views, and controllers all make sense and link together.

This is a small message board app, themed to one of my favorite childhood PC games called Maplestory.

The index page pulls data from a messages model and displays them on the index view using EJS templating. Users are able to navigate to a +New message page where they can submit a message via a form which then gets displayed on the main index page via a POST request.

A small app, but an important one as I slowly learn about backend principles.

Technologies used: - Node.js - Express.js - EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates) - MVC Architecture (Model–View–Controller) - HTML - CSS3 - JavaScript - Express Router and Middleware
